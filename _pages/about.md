Welcome to my homepage! (Last edited in Apr. 2024)

I am Mingchong Li (李鸣翀), a junior student from [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn), [Peking University](https://pku.edu.cn), major in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics.

I have a wide range of interests in Algebraic Geometry and Complex Geometry. Right now I'm trying to apply to grad school in Europe or the US in the field of algebraic geometry.

I have conducted research on derived category under the guidance of Prof. Bohan Fang and I'm still in the reading and learning stage.


You can learn more about me from my [CV](https://elainamath.github.io/cv) and [researches](https://elainamath.github.io/researches). Feel free to contact me if you have anything to chat!
